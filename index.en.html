    <h1>Aim of the game</h1>
    <p>Draw the borders of domains that completely fill a hexagon, each domain being filled with diamonds (or
        "calissons") of the same orientation (same color).
        A calisson is formed by joining two equilateral triangles with a common side.
        <br>
        The domains are separated by <strong>edges</strong> drawn as solid lines; the positions of the edges to be
        determined are drawn as dotted lines, with a small circle in the middle.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p> Two rules apply:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>a calisson is never crossed by an edge</strong> </li>
        <li><strong> there are no edges between two calissons of the same orientation.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p> To make the tiling unique, some edges are fixed at the start:</p>
    <p align="center"> <img src="./pictures/C2-aretes.png" alt=""></p>
    <p> Paving with calissons :</p>
    <p align="center"> <img src="./pictures/C2-calissons.png" alt=""></p>
    <p> To win, all you have to do is draw the borders of the domains, with the help of the calissons coloring if
        necessary:</p>
    <p align="center" style="font-size: smaller; text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
        <img src="./pictures/C2-frontieres.png" alt="">
        <br>
        winning position
    </p>
    <h2>Viewing the game in 3 dimensions</h2>
    <p>The hexagon's paving can be interpreted as the isometric projection of a stack of small cubic boxes in a large
        cubic room. The boxes are stacked by pushing them into the room as far as possible, the stacks increasing in
        height towards the back walls.</p>
    <p>This vision of the game often means you don't need calissons to draw the solution!</p>

    <h2>Drawing edges</h2>
    <p>
        On the computer, missing edges can be drawn by left-clicking on the center of the edge, while a calisson can be
        colored by right-clicking on the center of the diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
        On a tablet/telephone/touch screen, touching the middle of an edge causes the edge to be drawn or the diamond to
        be colored, depending on the state of an interface button.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: smaller; font-style: italic; ">
        Notes on resolution:
    <ul style="font-size: smaller; font-style: italic; ">
        <li>two known edges (solid or dotted) having a common point and forming an acute angle fully determine the
            orientation of the corresponding calisson ("acute angle rule" ["angle aigu" in the video just below])</li>
        <li>a solid edge on the boundary of a known calisson determines the orientation of the calisson having this edge
            in common ("fold rule" ["règle du pli" in the video])</li>
    </ul>
    </p>


    <h2>Resolution example</h2>
    <p>Solution of a size 3 grid using the acute angle and fold rules, with all calissons drawn.

        </video>
    </p>
    With practice, you can often do without calissons!
    <h1>The two game modes</h1>
    <h2>Training mode</h2>
    <p>In this mode, there's no time limit on the game, and you can choose the size and level of the grids to be solved
        from a drop-down list.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each grid solved, the score obtained is displayed, and a new grid is proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the event of a level change, the current grid is abandoned.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenge mode (Speedy!)</h2>
    <p>This mode lets you put your game skills to the test!</p>
    <p>The aim is to achieve the highest possible total score in the shortest possible time, by solving grids of
        increasing size and difficulty similar to those on the training page (but with different grids!).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>initial time credit: <strong>300 s</strong> </li>
        <li>every <strong>500</strong> pts, <strong>bonus of 60 s</strong></li>
        <li>The game is over when the time credit is used up.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The limited screen size of a smartphone can make it difficult to play with large grids. To make it easier to
        play under these conditions, you can set the maximum size of grids to be offered using the drop-down list below
        the game launch buttons. <br>
        The score obtained for each grid increases with this maximum size, so that the duration of the game remains more
        or less constant.
    </p>
    <h2>Controls</h2>
    <p>In both modes, two buttons can be used to change the flow of the game:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Reset</strong> resets the grid to its original state.
            <br>
            Useful when you want to start from scratch if you get stuck. This has no effect on the score, but you'll
            certainly have lost time in "Challenge" mode...
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Abort</strong> is more radical:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    the current grid is abandoned,
                </li>
                <li>
                    the solution is displayed for a brief moment,
                </li>
                <li>
                    In Challenge mode, a penalty is applied to the time credit ( <strong>- 60
                        s</strong> ),
                </li>
                <li>
                    the current grid is proposed again for solving.
                </li>
            </ul>
            This is useful when you find yourself completely stuck, or when you want to make it easier to start solving
            grids with no obvious starting point.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>Calisson coloring on computer or tablet/phone</h2>
    <p>When playing on a computer, you can draw calissons (or diamonds) by right-clicking on the middle of an edge.</p>
    <p>
        On touch-screen devices where right-clicking is not possible, the game pages display an indicator between the
        <strong>Reset</strong> and <strong>Abandon</strong> buttons, indicating whether pressing on the middle of an
        edge will draw an edge (<strong>Edge mode</strong>) or a rhombus (<strong>Diamond mode</strong>). Simply tap the
        indicator to change mode.

    </p>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>To obtain a high score, you must:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>find the solution to each grid as quickly as possible,</li>
        <li>a bonus is awarded for attempting to solve the last grid (don't give up, even if time is running out!)</li>
        <li>use a minimum number of calissons/diamonds, as the score decreases with the number used, and this takes
            time: the ideal is to use none at all!
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The score for each grid increases with its size and difficulty:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The easiest grids contain many more edges than necessary. They can usually be solved without using a single
            calisson.
        </li>
        <li>
            The most difficult grids contain a minimum number of edges, so solving them without a calisson is generally
            difficult.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
